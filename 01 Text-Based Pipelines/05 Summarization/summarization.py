    Interview Scenario: Summarization
    Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between abstractive and extractive summarization?
    A: Abstractive generates new text; extractive selects existing sentences.
    Key: Abstractive uses models like BART, extractive uses algorithms like TextRank.
    Example: pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
