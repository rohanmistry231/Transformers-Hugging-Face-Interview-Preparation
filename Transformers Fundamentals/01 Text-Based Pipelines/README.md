3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., sentiment analysis, QA).
4. **State-of-the-Art**: Leverages models like BERT, RoBERTa, and T5.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ NLP/AI roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering text-based pipelines for technical interviews‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: Text Classification
  - Day 3-4: Named Entity Recognition
  - Day 5-6: Question Answering
  - Day 7: Review and practice
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-2: Text Generation
  - Day 3-4: Summarization
  - Day 5-6: Translation
  - Day 7: Fill-Mask
- **Week 3**:
  - Day 1-7: Review all `.py` files and practice interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv transformers_env; source transformers_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install transformers torch numpy matplotlib`.
2. **Hugging Face Hub**:
   - Optional: Create a Hugging Face account for model access.
   - Install `huggingface_hub`: `pip install huggingface_hub`.
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews like ‚ÄúThis laptop is great!‚Äù).
   - Optional: Download datasets from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) (e.g., IMDb, SQuAD).
4. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python text_classification.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib visualizations (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Text Classification**:
   - Classify sentiment in retail reviews.
   - Visualize sentiment distribution.
2. **Named Entity Recognition**:
   - Extract entities from customer feedback.
   - Plot entity type frequencies.
3. **Question Answering**:
   - Answer questions about product descriptions.
   - Compare extractive vs. generative QA.
4. **Text Generation**:
   - Generate product review continuations.
